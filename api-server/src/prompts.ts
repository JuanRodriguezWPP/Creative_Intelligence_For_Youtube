    **Phase 1: Expert Critique and Evaluation**
    {{{{generationEvalPromptPart}}}}

    **CRITICAL: ALL evaluation text (Reasoning and ABCD sections) MUST be written in SPANISH, regardless of the video language ({{{{videoLanguage}}}}). Only the Title should be in ({{{{videoLanguage}}}}). All analysis, reasoning, and ABCD evaluation MUST be in SPANISH.**

    **REGLAS DE REDACCIÓN Y TONO (MÓDULO BETTER INSIGHTS):**
    1. **Principio Rector:** El rol no es proveedor de reportes descriptivos, es socio estratégico. Toda lectura debe responder a "¿Y esto qué significa para el objetivo de la campaña?".
    2. **Apertura de Negocio:** Inicia el resumen ejecutivo (campo 'description') declarando explícitamente el objetivo del cliente (ej. awareness, consideración, conversión). Toda evaluación debe leerse contra ese objetivo, no de forma genérica.
    3. **Consecuencia de Negocio (El 'Qué significa'):** Cada hallazgo, fortaleza y debilidad/oportunidad debe terminar su idea explicando qué mueve en el objetivo del negocio y en qué KPI de la solución se refleja. Evita el lenguaje suelto (ej. 'buen desempeño'); cada afirmación debe tener su dato y su consecuencia de negocio.
    4. **Tono y Lenguaje:** Consultivo, ejecutivo, en positivo. Reemplaza jerga técnica por lenguaje de negocio claro.
    5. **Regla de Oro (Accionabilidad):** Enmarca las debilidades en positivo como "oportunidades accionables", no como errores pasivos. Toda recomendación debe proponer una acción concreta de edición o mejora.
    6. **Estructura de Fortalezas:** Redacta cada viñeta de forma extremadamente directa y concisa (máximo 4-6 palabras). Ej: 'Hook inicial efectivo', 'Mensaje claro y relevante'.
    7. **Estructura de Debilidades/Oportunidades (H->V->N):** Redacta cada viñeta como una sola frase contundente que conecte: Hallazgo (qué pasa en el video) -> Valor (por qué importa para el objetivo) -> Next Step (acción sugerida).
    8. **CERO ALUCINACIONES (CRÍTICO):** Basa todo tu análisis ÚNICA Y EXCLUSIVAMENTE en el Video Script provisto. NO inventes elementos visuales, logos (ej. marcas ajenas), personajes o diálogos que no existan explícitamente en el guion. Si no encuentras debilidades reales, no las inventes; enfócate en optimizaciones sutiles.
    9. **EVALUACIÓN ABCD OBLIGATORIA:** Bajo NINGUNA circunstancia puedes dejar la dimensión "direction" vacía. Debes generar EXACTAMENTE 1 tarjeta informativa estructurada para CADA dimensión (Attention, Branding, Connection, Direction) detallando el Hallazgo, Valor y Acción.

    **CATÁLOGO DE FORMATOS WPP (Referencia complementaria):**
    DESPUÉS de dar tu recomendación creativa en las tarjetas ABCD o en fortalezas/debilidades, si aplica, sugiere qué formato WPP podría ayudar a implementar esa acción. Los formatos son un complemento, NO deben reemplazar ni condicionar la recomendación creativa.
    Formatos disponibles:
    - **Branded Bar:** Elementos gráficos superpuestos (barra superior/inferior) que captan atención sin interrumpir la reproducción. Ideal para destacar mensajes, promociones o gráficas complementarias.
    - **Video Card:** Frame de 3-5 segundos al inicio, intermedio o cierre del video para mostrar información complementaria (mapas, galerías, textos). Puede incorporar CTA o QR.
    - **Canvas:** El video se reduce y alrededor aparece un lienzo de marca con gráficos, mensajes, ofertas y/o QR, ampliando el espacio de comunicación sin ocultar el contenido principal.
    - **Amplification:** A partir de recursos existentes se crean nuevos formatos para alcanzar nuevas audiencias en cualquier dispositivo, maximizando inversión.
    - **QR Code:** Integración de código QR dentro del video para dirigir al usuario a una página de producto, landing page o formulario.

  /**
   * Video Variant Generation Prompts
   */
  generationPrompt: `**Objective:** Generate shorter, highly engaging video ad scripts by strategically combining scenes from a provided script, focusing on maximizing impact and adhering to specific criteria.

    **Instructions:**

    **Phase 1: Expert Script Combination (Focus: Engagement, Branding, and User Directives)**

    1.  **Role:** Assume the role of an expert video ad script writer specializing in maximizing viewer engagement.
    2.  **Core Task:** Create shorter, impactful script combinations by intelligently selecting and combining scenes from the provided original video ad script.
    3.  **User Directive Interpretation (Crucial):**
        *   **Input Format:** The user has provided their directive in a single free-form text field: {{userPrompt}}.
        *   **Empty Input (No Directive):** If the {{userPrompt}} field is *empty*, the user has provided *no specific directive*. In this case, *follow the "Key Combination Guidelines" below*.
        *   **"Focus" Interpretation (Inclusion):** If the user's directive clearly indicates a *focus* or *emphasis* on specific elements (e.g., "focus on product X," "highlight scenes with cars," "emphasize the family moments"), treat this as an *inclusion* directive. Prioritize scenes containing those elements.
        *   **"Exclusion" Interpretation (Exclusion):** If the user's directive clearly indicates an *exclusion* or *avoidance* of specific elements (e.g., "exclude scenes with person Y," "avoid any shots of the city," "remove scenes with the old logo"), treat this as an *exclusion* directive. *Absolutely avoid* including scenes containing those elements.
        *   **Ambiguous Input (Default to Inclusion):** If the user's directive is ambiguous or doesn't clearly indicate either focus or exclusion (e.g., "cars," "red," "night"), *treat this as an inclusion directive*. Prioritize scenes containing those elements. If it is completely unrelated to the content of the script, ignore it.
    {{{{brandGuidelines}}}}
    4.  **Key Combination Guidelines (Strictly Adhere):**
        *   **Memorable & Concise:** Each combination must convey the core message of the original ad in a memorable way, using *more than one scene but never all scenes*.
        *   **Prioritize Key Elements:** Scenes featuring logos, brands, products, or on-screen text are *crucial*. Prioritize their inclusion.
        *   **Strong Conclusion:** The *final scene of the original script is paramount*. Always include it as the concluding scene of every combination.
        *   **Speech & Text Coherence:** Prioritize scenes with off-screen speech or on-screen text. Ensure a logical flow and coherent message within the combined scenes. Avoid jarring transitions.
        *   **Target Duration (CRITICAL - Must be within {{expectedDurationRange}}):** Aim for a duration of approximately {{desiredDuration}} seconds. This is an *absolutely critical requirement*. The combined scenes *must* result in a duration within the range of {{expectedDurationRange}}. Use the provided scene durations to calculate the total duration of each combination. *Failing to calculate and adhere to the duration range using the provided durations will result in a score of 1.* To achieve this:
            *   **Duration Calculation (Mandatory):** *Explicitly calculate the total duration* of each combination by summing the durations of the included scenes.
            *   **Scene Selection Strategy:** Carefully consider the estimated length of each scene when selecting them. Prioritize shorter scenes if needed to stay within the duration range.
            *   **Iterative Refinement:** If an initial combination exceeds the duration range, *remove less essential scenes* until it fits. If it's significantly shorter, consider adding a short, relevant scene, if possible.
            *   **Duration is Paramount:** The duration constraint is *more important than including every single prioritized element*. If including all prioritized elements makes the combination too long, *remove some of those elements* to meet the duration requirement.
        *   **No Full-Script Combinations:** *Absolutely never* include all scenes from the original script in a combination.

    **Phase 2: Expert Critique (Rigorous Evaluation and Recommendations), Scoring and Justification (Detailed Analysis)**

    {{{{generationEvalPromptPart}}}}

    **CRITICAL: ALL evaluation text (Reasoning and ABCD sections) MUST be written in SPANISH, regardless of the video language ({{videoLanguage}}). Only the Title should be in {{videoLanguage}}. All analysis, reasoning, and ABCD evaluation MUST be in SPANISH.**

    **Constraints (Strictly Enforce):**
        *   Each combination must include *more than one scene* but *never all scenes* from the original script {{videoScript}}.
        *   Each combination *must* fall within the specified duration range: {{expectedDurationRange}}.
        *   Every scene number used in a generated combination must exist in the original script {{videoScript}}. Generating a combination that includes a non-existent scene number (e.g., suggesting "5" when the script only has scenes 1-3) is a critical failure and will render the entire output useless.
        *   ALL output text except the Title must be in SPANISH.
        *   **EVALUACIÓN ABCD OBLIGATORIA:** Bajo NINGUNA circunstancia puedes dejar la dimensión "direction" (o cualquier otra) vacía.

  prioritization: `Eres un consultor creativo experto en experimentación publicitaria y optimización de video para YouTube Ads. Tu objetivo es diseñar un "Testing Framework" accionable basado en los datos proporcionados.

Contexto completo: {{compassContextJson}}

Tu tarea es analizar el "Contexto de campaña", la "Evaluación creativa" (ABCD) y la "Inteligencia Geográfica" (territorios) para formular de 2 a 3 experimentos creativos (tests).
Cada test debe proponer una adaptación territorial o mejora creativa específica, justificada por una hipótesis medible.

REGLAS ESTRICTAS PARA EL DISEÑO DEL TESTING FRAMEWORK:
1. **Anclaje en los Datos:** Las recomendaciones deben basarse 100% en las debilidades reales detectadas en el análisis ABCD y en las oportunidades señaladas en los territorios geográficos. NO inventes debilidades que no existan.
2. **Alineación de Formatos:** Si se especifican formatos disponibles (ej. "Skin", "Video Card", "Canvas", "Amplification"), asegúrate de que tus variantes propuestas los utilicen.
3. **Hipótesis Clara:** La hipótesis debe conectar directamente la recomendación creativa con una métrica de negocio (ej. "Incluir un CTA en formato Video Card aumentará el CTR en el territorio urbano").
4. **Métricas de Éxito Reales:** Propón 2 a 3 métricas estándar de YouTube Ads o Brand Lift que tengan sentido lógico con el objetivo de la campaña (Ej: VTR, Ad Recall, CTR, Consideración de marca). No inventes KPIs.
